          <h1>Year 1</h1>
          <p>
            In my first year of university, I immersed myself in foundational
            computing concepts and programming skills. I began with a
            comprehensive study of Computer Foundations, where I explored the
            basic principles of computer systems, hardware, software, and
            networking. This course provided me with a solid understanding of
            how computers operate and interact with each other. Building on this
            knowledge, I delved into C Programming, a course that introduced me
            to the fundamentals of coding, including syntax, control structures,
            data types, and memory management. Through practical assignments and
            projects, I honed my problem-solving skills and learned how to write
            efficient and effective code. Additionally, I focused on developing
            essential Soft Skills, such as effective communication, teamwork,
            and time management. These skills are crucial for collaborating with
            others, managing projects, and presenting ideas clearly. Together,
            these courses laid a strong foundation for my continued studies in
            computer science and prepared me for more advanced topics in
            subsequent years.

          <h1>Year 2</h1>
          <p>
            In my second year of university, I advanced my studies by tackling
            more complex topics in computer science. I began with Data
            Algorithms, where I explored various algorithmic techniques for
            solving computational problems efficiently. This course emphasized
            the importance of designing algorithms with optimal time and space
            complexity, and I gained hands-on experience with sorting,
            searching, and graph algorithms. Concurrently, I expanded my
            programming expertise with C++, diving into object-oriented
            programming, classes, and advanced features like templates and
            exception handling. This language built upon the skills I acquired
            in C Programming, offering a broader set of tools for software
            development. Additionally, I learned Python, a versatile and
            powerful language known for its readability and ease of use. I
            applied Python to data analysis, web development, and scripting
            tasks, further enhancing my programming proficiency. Finally, I
            studied Networking Concepts, which introduced me to the fundamentals
            of network communication, protocols, and security. This course
            provided a comprehensive understanding of how data is transmitted
            across networks.

          <p>
            In my third year of university, I delved into a range of specialized
            topics that further broadened my expertise in computer science. I
            studied Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language known
            for its portability and robustness. Through Java, I explored
            object-oriented programming principles, and built applications with
            graphical user interfaces and backend functionalities. Additionally,
            I learned C#, a language developed by Microsoft, which allowed me to
            work with the .NET framework and create Windows applications, as
            well as develop web services. I continued to build on my networking
            knowledge with an advanced course on Networking, where I studied
            network architecture, management, and security in greater depth.
            This included exploring more complex networking protocols and
            troubleshooting techniques. Another key area of focus was
            Information Systems Analysis and Design (ISAD), where I learned
            methodologies for analyzing and designing information systems. This
            course covered requirements gathering, system modeling, and project
            management, equipping me with skills to effectively design and
            implement software solutions. Finally, I took a Statistics course
            that provided a strong foundation in data analysis, probability, and
            statistical inference.

            As part of my scholarship focused on frontend development, I had the
            opportunity to immerse myself in a range of essential technologies
            and frameworks. I began by learning HTML and CSS, which provided me
            with a solid foundation in creating structured and styled web pages.
            HTML enabled me to build the structural elements of a webpage, while
            CSS allowed me to style and layout these elements, ensuring a
            visually appealing and responsive design. Next, I delved into
            JavaScript, the cornerstone of interactive web development. Through
            JavaScript, I learned how to add dynamic behavior to web pages,
            manage user interactions, and manipulate the Document Object Model
            (DOM) to enhance user experience. Building on these skills, I
            studied Java, which expanded my programming capabilities beyond
            frontend development and introduced me to object-oriented
            programming principles and backend development. To round out my
            frontend expertise, I explored React, a powerful JavaScript library
            for building user interfaces. React taught me how to create reusable
            components, manage state, and efficiently render updates, all of
            which are crucial for developing modern, scalable web applications.
            This comprehensive curriculum has equipped me with the skills to
            create robust, interactive, and visually appealing web applications,
            preparing me for a career in frontend development.
